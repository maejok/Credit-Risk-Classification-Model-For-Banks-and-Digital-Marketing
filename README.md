This study is about the binary classification of loan seeking bank customers based on whether they are likely to defualt or not.  When a customer seeks for a loan, banks and other credit providers should use statistical models to determine whether or not to grant the loan based on the likelihood of the loan being repaid or not.

This model predicts loan repayment or default based on the data provided.
